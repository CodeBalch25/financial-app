## Understanding the Dashboard

Once you've added all your income sources, you'll see:

### 1. Summary Cards

**Total Monthly Income**
- Shows combined income from ALL sources
- Example: If you earn $4,000 + $1,500 + $3,500 + $1,200 + $2,500 = $12,700/month

**Total Annual Income**
- Your monthly income × 12
- Example: $12,700 × 12 = $152,400/year

**Average Per Source**
- Total monthly income divided by number of sources
- Example: $12,700 ÷ 5 sources = $2,540 average

### 2. Income by Type Chart (Pie Chart)

Shows what percentage of your income comes from:
- Primary jobs (you + wife)
- Secondary jobs
- Side businesses (Turo + Consulting)
- Freelance work

## How the Calculations Work

The system automatically converts all income to monthly and annual:

**Weekly → Monthly:**
- Amount × 52 weeks ÷ 12 months
- Example: $1,000/week = $1,000 × 52 ÷ 12 = $4,333/month

**Bi-weekly → Monthly:**
- Amount × 26 pay periods ÷ 12 months
- Example: $2,000 bi-weekly = $2,000 × 26 ÷ 12 = $4,333/month

**Monthly → Monthly:**
- No conversion needed
- Example: $3,500/month = $3,500/month

**Quarterly → Monthly:**
- Amount ÷ 3 months
- Example: $12,000/quarter = $4,000/month

**Annually → Monthly:**
- Amount ÷ 12 months
- Example: $48,000/year = $4,000/month

**Variable:**
- Use the monthly average you enter
- Great for side businesses with varying income

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I track gross or net income?**
A: Use the amount you actually receive (net/take-home pay). This is what you have available to budget.

**Q: My side business income varies. What amount should I enter?**
A: Use your 3-6 month average. Update it quarterly as the average changes.

**Q: Should I include one-time bonuses?**
A: For regular bonuses (annual), divide by 12 and add to monthly. For true one-time bonuses, add as a separate "Other" income source.

**Q: Can I track historical changes?**
A: Currently, edit the amount when it changes. We track current income. For history, use the Net Worth snapshots feature.

**Q: Should I include my spouse's income?**
